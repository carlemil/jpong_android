# Pong UI for android

Agenda for 2015-02-27 competences-day.

Try out some frameworks for fetching images/json data over the network and for annotating your app (getting rid of boilerplate code).

Frameworks:
Dagger2
Android annotations
Volley
Picaso
Butterknife
Spring
Robodjuce
Know of any other frameworks? add them here!

1. Fetch data from the json feeds and populate the "Math history" page using some or all of the frameworks.
2. Fetch the Jayway logo from the server.
3. Remove all boilerplate code using annotations.
