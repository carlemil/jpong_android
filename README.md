# Pong UI for android

In the ChatActivity you can find a stub that shows how to talk over a websocket. 
Using the server found at http://jaywaypongserver.herokuapp.com/ or by running it locally
(find it on github: https://github.com/jayway/KHelgGameServer) you are to implement a "pong" game.
If you chose to control the "paddle" yourself or let the program control it is up to you.
